### Generate Cursor Rules â€“ Working Directory Discipline

- Always run `pwd` first and record the path in the status update before any t
ool calls when handling requests like "/Generate Cursor Rules".
- If a shell is available, execute `pwd | cat` to avoid pagers. Example command to run:

```bash
pwd | cat
```

- Mention the current working directory explicitly in your micro status update right before executing any subsequent commands or file edits.
- If the working directory is not the project root, `cd` to the repository root before proceeding with rule generation or edits.
